# Midterm-Bot

This project is a twitter bot was made to retweet relevant tweets from a group of prominent NBA reporters using node.js, the "Twit" npm package as well as the "string-similarity" package. The bot uses the twitter ID of the reporters to retweet their most recent tweets. The purpose of the bot was to have a stream of information to keep up with the NBA. To avoid similar information being retweeted more than once, the npm package "string-similarity" to compare the tweets and evaluate its similarity compared to previously retweeted information.
